Building and Running
====================

1.)  Make sure the ../../data directory has the input and output files.
2.)  Load the Intel Compiler Suite 2017 (not tested with previous versions)
3.)  Type 'make'
4.)  Type 'make run' to run the original data set, or 'make run$' for $=1,2,3
     to run the SKA data sets


Environment Variables
=====================

1.)  OMP_NUM_THREADS: set to number of cores (i.e. disable hyper threading)
     On KNL we set this to 136, but it will vary across KNLs since they don't
     all have the same number of physical cores.  Experiment.
2.)  Set KMP_AFFINITY=scatter
3.)  Set KMP_BLOCKTIME=0
